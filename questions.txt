What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

-Responsive Web Design provides the optimal viewing experience of a website, no matter what type of device the user is seeing it on.
Adaptive web design is different from responsive design in that there isn’t one layout that always changes. 
So a responsive website would be able to move to moblie and it would adujust to it. The adaptive could do that to but it wouldn't look so good. You would have to shrink in on everything and it would be a pain to deal with.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
